Template literals are a powerful feature in JavaScript that make working with strings easier and more expressive. They provide a more elegant way to create strings than traditional string concatenation. Here's a breakdown with code examples:

**Key Features**

* **Backticks (``):** Template literals are defined using backticks instead of single or double quotes.
* **String Interpolation:** You can embed variables and expressions directly within a string using `${}`.
* **Multi-line Strings:** Template literals can span multiple lines without the need for special escape characters.

**Code Examples**

1. **Basic String Interpolation:**

   ```javascript
   const name = "Alice";
   const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
   console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Alice!
   ```

2. **Expressions within Interpolation:**

   ```javascript
   const price = 20;
   const quantity = 5;
   const total = `Total cost: ${price * quantity}`;
   console.log(total); // Output: Total cost: 100
   ```

3. **Multi-line Strings:**

   ```javascript
   const message = `
     This is a multi-line string.
     It can span multiple lines 
     without any special characters.
   `;
   console.log(message); 
   // Output:
   //  This is a multi-line string.
   //  It can span multiple lines 
   //  without any special characters. 
   ```

**Benefits of Template Literals**

* **Readability:** Template literals make strings much easier to read, especially when dealing with complex concatenations or multi-line strings.
* **Maintainability:**  They reduce the need for messy string concatenation, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
* **Flexibility:** You can embed any valid JavaScript expression within the `${}` placeholders, giving you a lot of flexibility in how you construct your strings.

**Comparison with Traditional Strings**

Traditional string concatenation:

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const age = 30;
const message = "My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.";
```

With template literals:

```javascript
const name = "Alice";
const age = 30;
const message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`; 
```

As you can see, template literals provide a much cleaner and more concise way to achieve the same result.
