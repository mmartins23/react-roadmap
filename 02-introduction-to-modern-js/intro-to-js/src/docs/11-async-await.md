Async/await is a modern feature in JavaScript that makes working with asynchronous code, particularly promises, much cleaner and easier to read. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves a bit more like synchronous code.

**1. `async` keyword**

The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. An async function always returns a promise.

```javascript
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  // ... function body
}
```

Even if you don't explicitly return a promise, the result of an `async` function will be implicitly wrapped in a promise.

**2. `await` keyword**

The `await` keyword can only be used inside an `async` function. It pauses the execution of the function until the promise it's awaiting is resolved. Once the promise is resolved, `await` returns the resolved value.

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

In this example, `await` pauses the execution until the `fetch()` promise resolves, and then again until the `response.json()` promise resolves. This makes the code read more sequentially, even though it's performing asynchronous operations.

**3. Error Handling**

You can use `try...catch` blocks to handle errors in async/await functions:

```javascript
async function getHeroData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/heroes/IronMan');
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('There has been a problem with your fetch operation:', error);
  }
}

getHeroData();
```

**4. Example with `setTimeout`**

```javascript
async function delayedGreeting() {
  console.log("Hello...");
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Wait 2 seconds
  console.log("...World!");
}

delayedGreeting(); // Outputs "Hello..." after 2 seconds "...World!"
```

**Benefits of Async/Await:**

* **Cleaner Code:** Makes asynchronous code more readable and easier to follow.
* **Simplified Error Handling:** Integrates seamlessly with `try...catch` blocks.
* **Better Debugging:** Easier to debug compared to traditional promise chains.

Async/await significantly improves the developer experience when working with asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It provides a more synchronous-like style while retaining the advantages of promises.
