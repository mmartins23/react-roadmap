### Summary: `npm test -- --coverage`

The `npm test -- --coverage` command in Jest provides a detailed coverage report of your tests. This helps you assess how much of your code is being tested and identify areas that need better test coverage.

#### Key Features of the Coverage Report:
1. **Statement Coverage**:
   - Shows the percentage of code statements executed during tests.
2. **Branch Coverage**:
   - Indicates the percentage of conditional branches (e.g., `if` or `else` blocks) that were tested.
3. **Function Coverage**:
   - Reports the percentage of functions or methods invoked during tests.
4. **Line Coverage**:
   - Displays the percentage of lines of code that were executed.

#### Outputs:
1. **Terminal**:
   - A summary is displayed directly in the terminal.
2. **Directory**:
   - A `coverage/` folder is created with a detailed HTML report you can open in a browser for deeper insights.

#### Best Practices:
- Regularly monitor the coverage report to ensure your tests are thorough.
- Aim for high percentages across all categories (statements, branches, functions, lines) to achieve robust test coverage.
- Use the report to identify untested areas and add appropriate tests.

This command is a powerful tool to ensure that your codebase is well-tested and reliable.
