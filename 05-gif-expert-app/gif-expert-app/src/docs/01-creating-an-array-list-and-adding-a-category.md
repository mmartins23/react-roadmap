### **Explanation:**

#### **1. Creating an Array List of Categories**
The array list of categories is created using the `useState` hook in React.

```javascript
const [categories, setCategories] = useState(['One Punch', 'DBZ']);
```

- **`useState`**: 
  - This hook is used to manage state in a functional component.
  - The initial state is set to an array containing two strings: `['One Punch', 'DBZ']`.

- **State Variables**:
  - `categories`: This is the current state, which holds the list of category names.
  - `setCategories`: This is the function used to update the state.

When the component is rendered, `categories` is an array that contains the items `'One Punch'` and `'DBZ'`.

#### **2. Adding a New Category to the List Array**
The function `handleAddCategory` is used to add a new item (`'Pokemon'`) to the existing list.

```javascript
const handleAddCategory = () => {
    setCategories([...categories, 'Pokemon']);
};
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **`[...categories]`**:
    - This is the spread operator. It creates a new array by copying all the elements from the existing `categories` array.
    - This ensures immutability, meaning the original array is not directly modified.
  
  - **Adding `'Pokemon'`**:
    - After spreading the current categories into a new array, `'Pokemon'` is appended as a new item to the end of the array.

  - **`setCategories`**:
    - This updates the `categories` state with the new array. React re-renders the component to reflect the changes in the list.

#### **How the List Updates in the UI**
1. **Mapping Over the Categories**:
   ```javascript
   {categories.map(category => (
       <li key={category}>{category}</li>
   ))}
   ```
   - `categories.map()` iterates over each item in the `categories` array.
   - For each `category`, it creates an `<li>` element displaying the category name.
   - The `key` attribute is used to uniquely identify each item, which helps React optimize rendering.

2. **State Update on Button Click**:
   - When the **Add** button is clicked:
     ```javascript
     <button onClick={handleAddCategory}>Add</button>
     ```
     - The `handleAddCategory` function is executed.
     - `'Pokemon'` is added to the `categories` array.
     - React re-renders the component, and the new list is displayed with the additional category.

---

### **Result in the UI**
1. Initial List:
   ```
   - One Punch
   - DBZ
   ```
2. After Clicking the "Add" Button:
   ```
   - One Punch
   - DBZ
   - Pokemon
   ```

This process demonstrates how React state management and re-rendering work together to dynamically update the UI.
