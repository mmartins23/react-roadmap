### **Purpose of the Code**

The code demonstrates how to use the `useMemo` hook to optimize performance by memoizing the result of a computationally expensive function (`factorial`). It prevents unnecessary recalculations when unrelated state changes.

---

### **Key Elements of the Code**

#### 1. **State Variables**

- **`number`:** Stores the number for which the factorial is calculated.
- **`counter`:** A separate state used to demonstrate how `useMemo` avoids recalculating the factorial when this unrelated state changes.

#### 2. **Factorial Function**

```javascript
const factorial = (n) => {
  console.log("Calculating factorial...");
  if (n <= 0) return 1; // Base case: factorial of 0 or negative is 1
  return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive calculation
};
```

- This function is **recursive**, meaning it calls itself repeatedly until it reaches the base case (`n <= 0`).
- For example, `factorial(3)` computes as:
  ```
  3 * factorial(2)
  2 * factorial(1)
  1 * factorial(0)
  1
  Result: 6
  ```
- The **`console.log("Calculating factorial...")** outputs to show when the function is recalculated.

---

#### 3. **Memoizing the Factorial Calculation**

```javascript
const memoizedFactorial = useMemo(() => factorial(number), [number]);
```

- **`useMemo`:**
  - Accepts a function (`() => factorial(number)`) and a dependency array (`[number]`).
  - Only recomputes the factorial **when `number` changes**.
  - If the `number` is the same, `useMemo` returns the cached result from the previous computation.

- **Why It Matters:**
  - Without `useMemo`, `factorial` would run every time the component re-renders, even if the `number` hasn’t changed (e.g., when updating `counter`).
  - Memoization avoids wasting resources on redundant calculations.

---

#### 4. **User Interaction**

##### Enter a Number:

```javascript
<input
  type="number"
  value={number}
  onChange={(e) => setNumber(Number(e.target.value))}
/>
```

- Updates the `number` state when the user types into the input.
- Triggers a recalculation of the factorial because `number` changes.

##### Increment Counter:

```javascript
<button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>
  Increment Counter: {counter}
</button>
```

- Updates the `counter` state.
- Does **not** trigger a recalculation of the factorial because `counter` is not a dependency of `useMemo`.

---

#### 5. **Rendering**

```javascript
<p>Factorial: {memoizedFactorial}</p>
```

- Displays the memoized factorial result.

---

### **Behavior of the Code**

1. **Initial Render:**
   - The factorial function runs once with `number = 0`.
   - Memoized result: `1`.

2. **Changing the Number:**
   - If the user enters a new number (e.g., `3`), the factorial function is recalculated.
   - Memoized result: `6`.

3. **Incrementing Counter:**
   - Clicking "Increment Counter" updates the `counter` state.
   - Does not trigger a recalculation of the factorial because `number` hasn’t changed.

4. **Console Logs:**
   - The log `"Calculating factorial..."` appears **only when `number` changes**.

---

### **Why `useMemo` is Useful**

Without `useMemo`, every state update (like `counter`) would cause the `factorial` function to run again, even though `number` hasn’t changed. This is inefficient, especially for complex calculations or large data sets.

---

### **Testing the Code**

1. Enter `5` in the input:
   - Console: `"Calculating factorial..."` (Result: `120`).
2. Click "Increment Counter":
   - Counter updates, but the factorial isn’t recalculated.
3. Change the number to `6`:
   - Console: `"Calculating factorial..."` (Result: `720`).
